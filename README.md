# TemporalEgoKCoreDemo
## Introduction
This is a demo for the historical k-core algorithm, based on the data generated from DBLP.
This system is still in development and for now, it only allows users to search for an researcher by name and check the historical k-core of a provided time window (minimum 1938 and maximum 2023 currently) of his ego network.
